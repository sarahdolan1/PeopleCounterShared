# People Counter Shared
As part of our summer internship, We (Sorcha & Sarah) have been asked to make a people counter code.
This code uses openCV and python to track people walking across a line in the middle of the screen whilst tracking their direction.
Inspiration for the code https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/08/13/opencv-people-counter/

## Recent Updates:
* All necessary documents have been uploaded; (videos have not, as no videos will be shared for this code).
* We have just posted our most recent version of our code that is fully functional & well commented, "people_counter.py".

## How To Use:
* Run: python people_counter.py  
* Ensure: In the code it states the video file name and loaction, so double check that is correct (line 244).

## Folders
* Mobilenet_ssd => Contains the MobileNet SSD model used (prototxt and caffe files)
* Pyimagesearch => Contains further code used to support the main people counter files
* Pycache => Contains a random configuration of files


## Setup
     1. Make sure you have OpenVINO installed
     2. Install the required libraries (OpenCV, NumPy, SciPy, dlib, imutils) by searching online or using pip install
     3. Download this git repo as a zip
     4. Extract the file to the Documents directory

## Running The Code
     5. Change directory
          ~ cd C:\Users\<USERNAME>\Documents\PeopleCounterShared
     6. Run the code
          ~ python people_counter.py
